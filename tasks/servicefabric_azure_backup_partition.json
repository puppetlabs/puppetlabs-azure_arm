In case the partition is already being periodically backed up, then by default the new backup is created at the same backup storage. One can also override the same by specifying the backup storage details as part of the request body. Once the backup is initiated, its progress can be tracked using the GetBackupProgress operation. In case, the operation times out, specify a greater backup timeout value in the query parameter.",

If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.Additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.",
