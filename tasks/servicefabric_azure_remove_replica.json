	"description": "This API simulates a Service Fabric replica failure by removing a replica from a Service Fabric cluster. The removal closes the replica, transitions the replica to the role None, and then removes all of the state information of the replica from the cluster. This API tests the replica state removal path, and simulates the report fault permanent path through client APIs. Warning - There are no safety checks performed when this API is used. Incorrect use of this API can lead to data loss for stateful services. In addition, the forceRemove flag impacts all other replicas hosted in the same process.",

This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.",
